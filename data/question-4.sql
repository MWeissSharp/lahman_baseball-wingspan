--Using the fielding table, group players into three groups based on their position: 
--label players with position OF as "Outfield", those with position "SS", "1B", "2B", and "3B" as "Infield", and those with position "P" or "C" as "Battery". 
--Determine the number of putouts made by each of these three groups in 2016.
